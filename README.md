## Project Description 

This is a game in which you can plant and sell strawberries and apples. 

To run the game, you will need to have Java 17 and Macalester Kilt Graphics as well as the ArrayList, List and HashMaps packages. To play the game itself, navigate to the file named "Garden.java" and run the main class. The screen opens with with a map of a world, to access any of the garden plots or the market, click on the label of the locations, such as "Strawberry Patch." In each garden, you can grow fruits by clicking on the dirt patch or tree three times. The fourth click collects the fruit and resets the fruit images so you can grow another one. When you have collected some fruits, by clicking on "go back" you can navigate back to the home screen where you can click on the market to sell your fruit. You can do this by clicking on the button to sell the fruits of your labor.

## Known issues

You can only plant one plant per plot or tree, but the image does not disappear when you harvest it, so the plants keep getting planted on top of one another when you try to plant another fruit after harvesting.

## Societal impact:
There could be a warning to people who are red-green color blind, as this game includes lots of green and red images that might be difficult to distinguish. Another societal impact of our game is it promotes capitalistic tendencies without the consequences of the inequalities that our buying and selling systems are built upon.
