## Project Description 

This is a game in which you can plant and sell strawberries and apples. 

To run the game, you will need to have Java 17 and Macalester Kilt Graphics as well as the ArrayList, List and HashMaps packages. To play the game itself, navigate to the file named "Garden.java" and run the main class. The screen opens with with a map of a world, to access any of the garden plots or the market, click on the label of the locations, such as "Strawberry Patch." [When you start the game, you have 10 strawberry and 10 apple blossoms, which will be used to plant seeds]. In each garden, you can grow fruits by clicking on the dirt patch or tree three times. The fourth click collects the fruit and resets the fruit images so you can grow another one. When you have collected some fruits, by clicking on "go back" you can navigate back to the home screen where you can click on the market to sell your fruit. By clicking on the button to sell the fruits of your gardening. [In the market, you can click to buy more seeds to plant in each patch].

## Known issues

The main bug/glitch in our program is that players have to click in a very specifc spot of the label in order to plant things or navigate between screens. You can also plant one plant per plot or tree, but can repeatedly harvest from them. 

## Societal impact:
There could be warning to people who are red-green color blind, as this game includes lots of green and red images that might hurt their eyes [is this what they want??]. Another societal impact of our game is it promotes capitalistic tendencies without the consequences of the inequaiities that our buying and selling systems are built upon.
