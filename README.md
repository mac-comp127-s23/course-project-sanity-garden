## Project Description 

This is a game in which you can plant and sell strawberries and apples. 

To run the game, you will need to have Java 17 and Macalester Kilt Graphics as well as the ArrayList, List and HashMaps packages. To play the game itself, navigate to the file named "Garden.java" and run the main class. The screen opens with with a map of a world, to access any of the garden plots or the market, click on the label of the locations, such as "Strawberry Patch." In each garden, you can grow fruits by clicking on the dirt patch or tree three times. The fourth click collects the fruit and resets the fruit images so you can grow another one. When you have collected some fruits, by clicking on "go back" you can navigate back to the home screen where you can click on the market to sell your fruit. You can do this by clicking on the button to sell the fruits of your labor. Once you leave either the strawberry patch or the apple orchard, if you are in the middle of growing a fruit (for example if you are at the sprout stage of the strawberry) it will reset to an empty patch / tree  when you return to the strawberry patch / apple orchard rather than continuing where you left off.

- The background for the market, main screen, apple orchard and strawberry patch were created in Canva. Most the graphics in these images were generated in were from the Canva library and some were pixelated using the Canva "pixelate" filter.

## Known issues

Sometimes when you harvest a plant the market will double count it. We also have ideas that we did not have time to implement. For example, you can sell fruit, but not buy anything with your money. We also could add more fruits to grow and make the growth timed so that you don't have to click for each stage, it just automatically updates after a certain amount of time.

## Societal impact
There could be a warning to people who are red-green color blind, as this game includes lots of green and red images that might be difficult to distinguish. Another societal impact of our game is it promotes capitalistic tendencies without the consequences of the inequalities that our buying and selling systems are built upon.

For your convenience, we have kindly provided a test mushroom image that helped along the process (aka as we were cleaning up our code and deleting all unused images, we purposely did not delete testMushroom.png because of sentimental value. It was not an oversight).
